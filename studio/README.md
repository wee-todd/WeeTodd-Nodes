# WeeTodd Studio

A native Swift macOS editor around the shared WeeTodd MLX renderer. The app lives in this
repository; it does not need a running ComfyUI server. This is an initial development build,
not a notarized consumer release.

## Build and open

Build on Apple Silicon with Xcode 26 or newer (the MetalFX frame interpolator uses the macOS 26 SDK):

```bash
python3 scripts/build_studio_app.py --configuration release
open "studio/.build/WeeTodd Studio.app"
```

The GUI supports macOS 14 and newer. Actual model/runtime requirements can require newer macOS.
MetalFX frame interpolation additionally requires macOS 26 and a supporting GPU. The helper checks
hardware support. The build script makes an ad-hoc signed application containing the Swift GUI,
`WeeToddCLI`, `StudioMetal`, the renderer source, and the runtime dependency lock. Building the
app does not install Python dependencies or copy models.

In **Studio Settings**, choose **Set Up Managed Renderer** to download private Python 3.12.13 and
install pinned, hash-verified native dependencies. The installer verifies arm64, the project Python
requirement, package consistency, and Metal availability before activating the new runtime.
Each installation gets a new directory; prior runtimes remain available. The developer environment
and other applications' environments are preserved. There is no Linux virtual machine.
The bootstrap uses a pinned, checksum-verified uv release from Astral.

Advanced users can connect an existing compatible WeeTodd repository and Python environment.
Import existing `weetodd-headless-v2` recipes to identify model component sets. Automatic selection
matches the clip engine and media roles. Model downloads and conversions are not automated by
this first GUI build. FFmpeg/FFprobe and optional RIFE remain separately configured tools;
a retail installer must package these tools with their licenses and finish the model setup flow.

Runtime settings, autosave, global assets, recipes, previews and jobs live under
`~/Library/Application Support/WeeTodd Studio`. User media and model weights stay in their existing
locations. `WEETODD_STUDIO_DATA` selects a separate data directory for isolated development tests.

## Editing

- Clip inspector at upper left, inherited movie settings below; central viewport and timeline;
  collapsible Global, Project, and selected Clip asset stores at right.
- System, Light, and Dark appearance. Section colors in the design wireframe are not used.
- One main video track, titles, and additional named audio tracks with mute, solo, and source-audio
  replacement. Set each region's start, source in, duration, volume and fades in its inspector.
- H3, LTX 2.3 and LTX 2.5 generated clips, imported movies/stills, and image sequences. Sequence import
  uses the movie frame rate, natural filename order, linked original frames and a ProRes editing proxy.
- Drop a movie asset on the timeline to create a clip and a source reference in its Clip Assets.
  Drop images on a generated clip near its beginning/end for endpoint conditioning, or in its middle
  for a timed keyframe. Roles can also be set explicitly. Drag clip cards to reorder them.
- Split rendered/imported clips, duplicate, edit source in/duration, and create extension clips.
  Before-extension is offered for LTX 2.3. Extension uses the referenced source movie as model context;
  trimmed timeline boundaries are not currently extracted into a new extension context automatically.
- **Insert Bridge to Next Clip** extracts the selected clip's last visible frame and the next clip's
  first visible frame. It creates an LTX 2.5 shot with linked first/last anchors and opens its prompt.
- The prompt editor fills the window. **Prepare clip** validates model paths, task support and inputs,
  then displays the exact resolved prompt. **Generate clip** executes that prepared recipe.
  H3 reference/audio/extension tasks currently require their complete native six-section prompt.
- Automatic task selection and the selected recipe's compatible adapters preserve the existing
  backend contracts. Controls expect preprocessed guide media. Missing or incompatible inputs fail;
  the editor does not guess an arbitrary ControlNet, LoRA, pose extractor or reference description.
- Generated versions remain in Clip Assets. Undo/redo and autosave protect edits. Collect Media writes
  a separate project with relative media references, including used Global assets. It preserves shared
  model/LoRA paths; it does not package weights or rewrite model recipes for another machine.

**Preview movie** builds a reduced-resolution movie containing the actual transitions, titles,
and active audio tracks. Clip preview is immediate; movie preview is rebuilt after edits. Missing
renders must be generated first. Movie preview omits interpolation/upscaling, which are applied
in final export. This first build does not provide live multitrack compositing or waveform editing.

## Status and actions

| Clip color | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Green | Generated source matches the current generation settings and linked inputs. |
| Yellow | A generated clip's settings or inputs changed, or a different version was selected. |
| Orange | A new clip has the required basic setup and is ready for full preflight. |
| Red | A generated clip has missing configuration or its last preflight needs attention. |
| Blue | Imported movie/still/sequence clip. Missing files appear in Actions. |

The status area's **Actions** button orders blockers before generation work, then save reminders
and suggestions. Each item opens the relevant clip, prompt, runtime settings, save or job export.
Output settings do not unnecessarily invalidate the source generation; finishing happens during export.

## Movie settings and finishing

Movie dimensions, frame rate, interpolation/upscaling, fit and format are inherited by every clip,
with optional clip overrides. Each clip finishes separately, then assembly conforms it to the movie
canvas and frame rate. Supported outputs are H.264 MP4/MOV, ProRes 422 HQ, or a PNG sequence plus WAV.
Current intermediate clips use H.264; ProRes and PNG output are not end-to-end lossless masters.

Finishing order is resize/upscale, then interpolate, then transitions/titles/audio assembly.
RIFE supports integer 2×/3×/4× interpolation with its configured MLX executable and weights.
MetalFX spatial upscaling uses the native helper. Neither method downloads models silently.

Experimental MetalFX frame interpolation supports 2× and requires genuine per-frame guides at the
processed clip's resolution and timing. Set depth and motion folders in the clip's advanced settings:

- `000001.f32` through the last input-frame index: tightly packed little-endian float32.
- Depth is one channel per pixel; motion is two channels of backward displacement in pixels.
- The depth folder must contain `camera.json` with `nearPlane`, `farPlane`, `fieldOfView` in degrees,
  and Boolean `depthReversed`, describing the actual guide camera.
- Guides must already match trimming, fit, dimensions, and frame rate. The app does not synthesize
  missing depth/motion or imply that ordinary movie files contain these buffers.

## Headless movie and clip jobs

Use **Movie → Export Movie Headless Job** or **Export Clip Headless Job**. A single
`.weetodd-job.json` embeds the edit, resolved generation recipes, runtime paths and finishing settings.
A companion text file describes execution. Files reference local media/models; collect the project
first if media needs to travel. A job still needs its recorded runtime and model locations.

The app contains a CLI launcher that finds the job's native Python automatically:

```bash
"/Applications/WeeTodd Studio.app/Contents/MacOS/WeeToddCLI" \
  --job Movie.weetodd-job.json --output-directory Render --preflight-only
"/Applications/WeeTodd Studio.app/Contents/MacOS/WeeToddCLI" \
  --job Movie.weetodd-job.json --output-directory Render --resume
```

Developers can also use the existing Python client directly:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/render_headless.py \
  --job Movie.weetodd-job.json --output-directory Render --resume
```

The editor can be closed. Jobs preflight all clips and finishing dependencies before generation,
run one generation process at a time, finish clips serially, and assemble the result with titles,
transitions and audio. Each model process exits before the next clip loads. The selected model's
minimum working memory still applies; headless execution cannot make an oversized model fit.
FFmpeg assembly can use additional memory for long edits with many transitions/audio inputs.

`--resume` verifies source observations and completed-artifact hashes, preserving completed renders
and finished clips. Changed jobs, renderer source or inputs require re-export/new output directories.
The output folder is locked against concurrent execution. Interruptions record job state; cancelling
passes through to the active child process. Existing unverified final exports are preserved.
A clip job retains only that clip's intersecting titles/audio, shifted into clip-local time.

## Validation and next release work

The initial validation includes Swift document tests; real FFmpeg movie/transition/title/audio and
sequence/anchor tests; job locking, integrity and resume tests; a real LTX 2.5 generated job and resume;
a fresh private-runtime installation; and real MetalFX spatial/RIFE and guided MetalFX interpolation.
The private-runtime test produced byte-identical generated and assembled MP4s to the development
runtime for the one-second LTX 2.5 fixture. This is a narrow integration check, not universal parity.

Before a broad consumer release: complete model discovery/download UI and tool packaging, sign and
notarize the app, test clean Macs and lower-memory hardware, qualify more conditioning combinations,
and improve live timeline playback. Useful next features are audio waveforms, proxy/cache management,
crash-recovery history, and a render-cost/memory estimate before queuing large movies.
