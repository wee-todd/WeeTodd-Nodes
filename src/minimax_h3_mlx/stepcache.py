"""Step-skipping for the joint denoiser — a TeaCache-class residual cache.

The observation TeaCache is built on is that a diffusion transformer's *output delta* changes
smoothly along the trajectory: consecutive steps often ask the stack to compute something very
close to what it just computed. When that is true the forward can be skipped entirely and the last
delta reused.

Two H3-specific choices:

* **Indicator.** The block-0 AdaLN-modulated input, as in the original. It is the first tensor in
  the stack that carries both the trajectory and the timestep, and producing it costs the two patch
  projections plus a 136-row text refiner — about 0.03% of a forward.
* **Residual.** H3's heads emit a *velocity* in the same shape as the rows they update, so the
  cached quantity is ``prediction - rows`` per modality. Video and audio ride one indicator because
  they ride one forward; skipping is all-or-nothing.

The accumulator is the honest part. Relative L1 between consecutive indicators is summed and the
forward is skipped only while that sum stays under ``threshold``; a real forward resets it. Error
therefore accrues on a budget rather than per-step, and ``max_skip`` caps how long the sampler can
coast even inside the budget. The first and last forwards are never skipped: the first has no
cached delta to reuse, and the last is what actually lands on the output manifold.
