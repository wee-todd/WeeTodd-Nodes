"""Quantization for the MiniMax-H3 DiT.

Read the performance note in the README before reaching for this. H3's bottleneck is **attention
FLOPs**, which quantization does not reduce — the linear layers are ~42% of the work for a 5 s clip
and ~20% for 15 s, so a 4-bit DiT is worth roughly 1.2-1.4x end to end. Quantizing H3 is about
fitting it on a smaller Mac, not about making generation quick.

What is and is not quantized, and why:

* **Quantized** — the block stack's `attn.qkv_proj`, `attn.out_proj`, `mlp.fc1`, `mlp.fc2`, and the
  same four in the token refiner. That is essentially all of the 20B core.
* **Never quantized** — the two input patch projections, `condition_proj`, the timestep MLP and the
  two output heads. These are float32 in the release for a reason (`_keep_in_fp32_modules` in the
  reference) and together are well under 1% of the model, so quantizing them buys nothing and costs
  precision exactly where the signal enters and leaves the stack.
* **`adaln_proj` is off by default but 8-bit is measured-safe** (`--quantize-adaln`). Its 13B is the
  largest block of parameters and, left at bfloat16, it dominates the download of every build — a
  3-bit core is 9 GB resident inside a 35 GB repository.

  The first-principles argument against quantizing it is that every block reads the same `temb`, so
  an error there biases all 50 blocks identically. That argument is wrong, and `eval_adaln_quant.py`
  is what showed it: the table is computed **once**, so quantization perturbs it like slightly
  different modulation weights rather than introducing drift that compounds along the trajectory.

  Measured shift in the modulation table, against the velocity error the *core* already carries at
  the same width:

  | adaln bits | table rel-L2 | worst tensor | core velocity rel-L2 |
  |---:|---:|---|---:|
  | 8 | **0.0025** | shift_mlp 0.0035 | 0.0329 |
  | 6 | 0.0031 | shift_mlp 0.0074 | 0.0611 |
  | 4 | 0.0077 | shift_mlp 0.0282 | 0.1649 |

  At 8 bits the table moves an order of magnitude less than the core's own error, for 12.2 GB off
  every download. The published builds use it; 4-bit AdaLN is measurably worse and is not
  recommended even when the core is 4-bit.

Norms and biases stay in their original precision throughout, as MLX's quantizer requires.
